Exercise 1: Identifying Data Types

Below are various data sources.
Identify whether each one is an example of structured or unstructured data.

A companyâ€™s financial reports stored in an Excel file.      - This is a structured data.  Because it's an excel spreadsheet table.
Photographs uploaded to a social media platform.            - This is unstructured data.
A collection of news articles on a website.                 - This is unstructured data.
Inventory data in a relational database.                    - This is a structured data.  Because it's in a database - many files that have a structure.
Recorded interviews from a market research study.           - This is unstructured data.

Exercise 5 : Export a dataframe to excel format and JSON format.

Create a simple dataframe.
Export the dataframe to an excel file.
Export the dataframe to a JSON file.

'''


import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Column1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Column2': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
    'Column3': [True, False, True, False, True]
})

# Export to CSV
df.to_csv('my_dataframe.csv')

# result:
# Column1,Column2,Column3
# 1,A,True
# 2,B,False
# 3,C,True
# 4,D,False
# 5,E,True


# Export to JSON
df.to_json('my_dataframe.json')

# result:
# {"Column1":{"0":1,"1":2,"2":3,"3":4,"4":5},"Column2":{"0":"A","1":"B","2":"C","3":"D","4":"E"},"Column3":{"0":true,"1":false,"2":true,"3":false,"4":true}}
