Exercise 1: Introduction to Data Analysis


Objective: Understand the basic overview and significance of data analysis.

Write a short essay or report on the following topics:

What is data analysis?
Why is data analysis important in modern contexts?
List and describe three areas where data analysis is applied today.


Data Analysis
---------------------------

What is Data Analysis?
Data analysis uses statistical and logical methods to understand, clean, and model the data.
This is so we can get insights and help the organization decision-making.

Why is Data Analysis Important?
Because today we live in a data-driven world.
Data analysis helps organizations make better decisions, improve efficiency and understand customers better.
It is also important for risk management, fraud detection, and predictive modeling.

Applications of Data Analysis
There are many fields in which Data Analysis is useful.
like:
Healthcare: Enhances patient medical results.
E-commerce: Increase sales by recommending personalized products.
Finance: Aids in risk management and fraud detection.

Current Trends
Integration of AI and machine learning for automation and enhanced analysis.
Augmented Analytics: Using AI to assist with data preparation, insight generation, and explanation.
Real-time analytics and visualization for timely decision-making.

Real-World Examples
LinkedIn uses data analytics to recommend job opportunities.
Uber relies on data analytics for dynamic pricing and route optimization.
Spotify uses data analytics to recommend songs and playlists based on user listening habits.

Exercise 2: Dataset Loading and Initial Analysis


Objective: Practice dataset loading from Kaggle and initial analysis.

for the following dataset : How Much Sleep Do Americans Really Get?, Global Trends in Mental Health Disorder and Credit Card Approvals.

Load the dataset into Jupyter or Google Colab.
Display the first few rows.
Provide a brief dataset description.

'''

For example:

from google.colab import files
files.upload()

(Upload the file: How_Much_Sleep_Do_Americans.zip)

!unzip /content/How_Much_Sleep_Do_Americans.zip

import pandas as pd
train_data = pd.read_csv('/content/Time Americans Spend Sleeping.csv')

print(train_data.head())

print(train_data.describe())

'''

Exercise 3: Identifying Data Types


Objective: Learn to identify different data types.

For the datasets from the previous exercise, categorize each column of it as either quantitative or qualitative and explain your reasoning.

'''

Time Americans Spend Sleeping.csv
all columns are quantitative

Mental health Depression disorder Data.csv
The "Entity" and "Code" fields are qualitative.
The rest are quantitative.

Credit_Card_Approvals_(Clean_Data).zip
I couldn't load it - there's an error.


Quantitative (Numerical Data): Columns containing numeric values that can be measured or counted and used in mathematical operations.
These can be:
Discrete: Whole numbers (e.g., number of students, product count)
Continuous: Measurable values (e.g., height, weight, temperature)

Qualitative (Categorical Data): Columns containing non-numeric values representing categories, labels, or characteristics.
These can be:
Nominal: Categories with no inherent order (e.g., gender, country, eye color)
Ordinal: Categories with a meaningful order but no uniform difference (e.g., satisfaction level, education level)

'''
Exercise 4: Exploring Data Types


Objective: Learn about different types of data in data analysis.

Load the Iris dataset using Kaggle into a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory Notebook.
Identify and list which columns in your dataset are qualitative and which are quantitative.
Write a brief description of why each column is classified as qualitative or quantitative.
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python with Pandas library.


'''


This is like exercise 2.

The "Species" column - is a category.
All other columns are Quantitative.

'''
Exercise 5: Basic Data Analysis with Google Colab


Objective: Perform basic data analysis using Google Colab.

Using the same notebook from the previous exercise, perform basic data analysis tasks:
Calculate the mean, median, and mode of a quantitative column.
Create a simple plot (like a histogram or bar chart) to visualize the data using Matplotlib/Seaborn libraries :

Document your findings in the notebook.
Tools: Google Colab, Python with Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn libraries.

'''

This is like exercise 2.

AND ALSO:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(train_data['Id'], train_data['SepalLengthCm'])
plt.show()


import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

mean_value = np.mean(data[quant_col])
median_value = np.median(data[quant_col])
mode_value = stats.mode(data[quant_col]).mode[0]



print ("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~")

'''

Exercise 6: Basic Observation Skills in Data Analysis

Objective: Develop observation skills for data analysis.

Load the How Much Sleep Do Americans Really Get? dataset into Jupyter or Google Colab.
Identify columns that could be interesting for a specific type of analysis (e.g., trend analysis, group comparison) and explain your choice.
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python with Pandas library.


'''

This is like exercise 2.

Time Americans Spend Sleeping.csv

The importand columns are "Age" and "Avg hrs per day sleeping".
These are the main important details.
We can check how many hours a person sleeps according to their age.
